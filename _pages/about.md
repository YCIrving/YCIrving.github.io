I am Yichen Gao, currently a master student in the School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University. I’m a member of the [CSCL](http://59.108.48.27/cscl/) group in the [Institute of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/). My main interest lies in computer vision and graphics.

# Projects

  - **Automatic Compression Algorithm of Chinese Font Based on Multi-level Multiplexing**
  
    To solve the problem of the use of Chinese fonts on embedded devices, this paper realizes an automatic Chinese fonts compress system based on the idea of multiplexing parts in Chinese glyphs. In the meanwhile, this project also proposes two algorithms that can be used during matching glyph parts: Three Features Matching and Overlap Matching.

  - **_Anonymized as required_**
  
    Designing a Chinese vector font library which can be used in real applications is very time-consuming, since the font library typically consists of large amounts of Chinese characters. To address this problem, we propose a data-driven system in which only a small number (about 10%) of characters need to be designed.
